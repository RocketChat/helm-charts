# Rocket.Chat

[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) is free, unlimited and open source. Replace email, HipChat & Slack with the ultimate team chat software solution.

> **WARNING**: Upgrading to chart version 3.1.x or higher might require extra steps to retain the MongoDB data. See [Upgrading to 3.1.0](#to-310) for more details.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install rocketchat rocketchat/rocketchat --set mongodb.auth.password=$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32)),mongodb.auth.rootPassword=$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32))
```

If you got a registration token for [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat), you can also include it: 
```console
$ helm install rocketchat rocketchat/rocketchat --set mongodb.auth.password=$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32)),mongodb.auth.rootPassword=$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32)),registrationToken=<paste the token here>
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) Deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. It provisions a fully featured Rocket.Chat installation.

In addition, this chart supports scaling of Rocket.Chat for increased server capacity and high availability.  For more information on Rocket.Chat and its capabilities, see its [documentation](https://rocket.chat/docs/).

## Prerequisites Details

The chart has an optional dependency on the [MongoDB](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) chart.
By default, the MongoDB chart requires PV support on underlying infrastructure (may be disabled).

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `rocketchat`:

```console
$ helm install rocketchat rocketchat/rocketchat
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `rocketchat` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete rocketchat
```

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install rocketchat -f values.yaml rocketchat/rocketchat
```

### Database Setup

Rocket.Chat uses a MongoDB instance to presist its data.
By default, the [MongoDB](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) chart is deployed and a single MongoDB instance is created as the primary in a replicaset.  
Please refer to this chart for additional MongoDB configuration options.
If you are using chart defaults, make sure to set at least the `mongodb.auth.rootPassword`, `mongodb.auth.username` and `mongodb.auth.password` values. 
> **WARNING**: The root credentials are used to connect to the MongoDB OpLog

#### Using an External Database

This chart supports using an existing MongoDB instance. Use the `` configuration options and disable MongoDB with `--set mongodb.enabled=false`

### Configuring Additional Environment Variables

```yaml
extraEnv: |
  - name: MONGO_OPTIONS
    value: '{"ssl": "true"}'
```
### Specifying aditional volumes

Sometimes, it's needed to include extra sets of files by means of exposing 
them to the container as a mountpoint. The most common use case is the 
inclusion of SSL CA certificates. 

```yaml
extraVolumes: 
  - name: etc-certs
    hostPath:
    - path: /etc/ssl/certs
      type: Directory
extraVolumeMounts: 
  - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs
    name: etc-certs   
    readOnly: true
```

### Increasing Server Capacity and HA Setup

To increase the capacity of the server, you can scale up the number of Rocket.Chat server instances across available computing resources in your cluster, for example,

```bash
$ kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/rocketchat
```

By default, this chart creates one MongoDB instance as a Primary in a replicaset.  This is the minimum requirement to run Rocket.Chat 1.x+.    You can also scale up the capacity and availability of the MongoDB cluster independently.  Please see the [MongoDB chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) for configuration information.

For information on running Rocket.Chat in scaled configurations, see the [documentation](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/docker-containers/high-availability-install/#guide-to-install-rocketchat-as-ha-with-mongodb-replicaset-as-backend) for more details.

### Manage MongoDB secrets

This chart provides several ways to manage the Connection for MongoDB
* Values passed to the chart (externalMongodbUrl, externalMongodbOplogUrl)
* An ExistingMongodbSecret containing the MongoURL and MongoOplogURL
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mongo-uri: mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/rocketchat
  mongo-oplog-uri: mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/local?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin
```


## Upgrading

### To 3.1.0

Due to changes on upstream [MongoDB chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb#to-800), many MongoDB variables have been renamed (including it's PersistentVolumeClaims), which also need to be changed for this package. The most important being:
  - `replicas` is renamed to `replicaCount`.
  - Authentication parameters are reorganized under the `auth.*` parameter:
    - `usePassword` is renamed to `auth.enabled`.
    - `mongodbRootPassword`, `mongodbUsername`, `mongodbPassword`, `mongodbDatabase`, and `replicaSet.key` are now `auth.rootPassword`, `auth.username`, `auth.password`, `auth.database`, and `auth.replicaSetKey` respectively.
  - `securityContext.*` is deprecated in favor of `podSecurityContext` and `containerSecurityContext`.
  - Parameters prefixed with `mongodb` are renamed removing the prefix. E.g. `mongodbEnableIPv6` is renamed to `enableIPv6`.
  - Parameters affecting Arbiter nodes are reorganized under the `arbiter.*` parameter.

Since mongodb has no backwards compatibility guarantee and recomends creating a new deployment and migrating your data, we recomend that too. This could be done with the following steps:

1. Create a new Rocket.Chat deployment. You may reuse your existing values, which can be checked with `helm get values <release_name>`, keeping in mind the changes mentioned above. 
2. Copy the database over. This could be done with: 
  ```
  kubectl exec <old_release_name>-mongodb-primary-0 -- mongodump -d <database_name> -u <old_mongodb_user> -p <old_mongodb_password> --archive | kubectl exec -i <new_release_name>-mongodb-0 -- mongorestore -d <database_name> -u <new_mongodb_user> -p <new_mongodb_password> --archive --drop
  ```  
  Example: 
  ```console
  kubectl exec my-rocketchat-mongodb-primary-0 -- mongodump -d rocketchat -u rocketchat -p changeme --archive | kubectl exec -i my-rocketchat2-mongodb-0 -- mongorestore -d rocketchat -u rocketchat -p changeme --archive --drop
  ```
  Note: If you are using PersistentVolumes for Rocket.Chat storage they will need to be copied over too.
1. Validate if the update completed sucessfully 
2. Remove the old deployment and change the corresponding ingress.
### To 1.1.0

Rocket.Chat version 1.x requires a MongoDB ReplicaSet to be configured. When using the dependent `stable/mongodb` chart (`mongodb.enabled=true`), enabling ReplicaSet will drop the PVC and create new ones. Make sure to backup your current MongoDB and restore it after the upgrade.

### To 1.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 1.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is rocketchat:

```console
$ kubectl delete deployment rocketchat-rocketchat --cascade=false
```
